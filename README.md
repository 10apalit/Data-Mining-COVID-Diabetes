# Social Media Mining to Analyze Discussion of Long COVID and Diabetes
The goal of this project is to analyze the
discussions taking place in social media
platforms, particularly Twitter, about Long
COVID and Diabetes and analyzing their
association. The tweets scraped include the
keywords Long COVID, COVID and Diabetes.
With the help of Exploratory Data Analysis, we
have acquired information such as Like Count,
Favorite Count, Retweet Count and top 10
hashtags, for these tweets. Furthermore, to
understand in-depth the topics that come up most
frequently while talking about the abovementioned keywords, we have used Topic
Modelling Algorithms like LDA, Short Text and
BERT and compared each algorithmâ€™s output to
obtain the most efficient algorithm for our
requirement. Finally, we have performed
Sentiment Analysis using models like Vader and
Zero-Shot Text Classification to figure out the
sentiments or emotions associated with the
tweets.
